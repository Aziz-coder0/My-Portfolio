  <h1 style="text-align:center;">TYPES OF COMPUTERS</h1>
  <br>
  <h2 style="background-color:red;">DESKTOP COMPUTER</h2>
  <p style="background-color:pink;">A type of computer designed to fit comfortably on top of a desk, typically with the monitor sitting on top of the system unit.<br> Desktop model computers are wide and short, while tower model computers are narrow and tall.<br> Due to their shape, desktop model computers are generally limited to three internal mass storage devices.<br>Desktop models designed to be very small are sometimes referred to as slimline models.</p>
  <br>
  <h2 style="color:maroon;">LAPTOP</h2>
  <p style="color:green;">A small, portable computer small enough that it can sit on your lap.<br> Today, computer laptops are more commonly referred to as notebook computers, but technically laptops are slightly larger in size than notebooks in both thickness and weight.</p>
  <br>
  <h2 style="font-family:Times New Roman;">TABLET</h2>
  <p style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> Tablet is a type of notebook computer that has an LCD screen on which the use can write using fingerhand swipe actions or by using a special-purpose pen,or stylus.<br> Unlike desktop computers, all user input is done directly on the tablet’s LCD screen.<br> Hand writing is digitized on a tablet computer and can be converted to standard text using handwriting recognition, or left as handwritten text. You can also use the stylus to type on a pen-based key layout.<br> In this ce lettered keys are arranged differently than the QWERTY keyboard.<br> Tablet PCs can be equipped with a keyoard and/or a mouse for input.</p>
  <p style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Based on digital ink technology, the tablet PC places a digitizer below or above an LCD screen to detect the movement of a special pen and generate an electromagnetic field that can capture the movement of the special-purpose pen and record the movement on the LCD screen.<br> The effect is like writing on paper with liquid ink.</p>
  <br>
  <h2 style="font-size:200%;">SMART PHONES</h2>
  <p style="font-size:150%;">Smartphones are a handheld device that integrates mobile phone capabilities with the more common features of a handheld computer or PDA.<br> Smartphones allow users to store information, send e-mails, install programs, along with using a mobile phone in one device.</p>
  <p style="font-size:150%;">For example, a smartphone could be a mobile phone with some PDA features built into the device, or vice versa.</p>
  <br>
  <h1 style="text-align:center;">COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEMS</h1>
  <p style="text-align:Right;">An operating system (OS) is a software that allows a user to run other applications on a computing device.</p>
  <p style="text-align:Left;">The operating system manages a computer's software and hardware resources, including:</p>
  <p style="text-align:Left;">1. Input devices such as a keyboard and mouse.</p>
  <p style="text-align:Left;">2. Output devices such as display monitors, printers, and scanners.</p>
  <p style="text-align:Left;">3. Network devices such as modems, routers, and network connections.</p>
  <p style="text-align:Left;">4. Storage devices such as internal and external drives.</p>
  <p style="text-align:Left;">The OS also provides services to facilitate the efficient execution, management, and memory allocations for any additional installed software application programs.</p>
  <br>
  <h2><b>CLASSIFICATION OF OPERATING SYSTEM</b></h2>
  <p><b>Multi-user: Allows two or more users to run programs at the same time.</b></p>
  <p><strong>Multiprocessing: Supports running a program on more than one CPU.</strong></p>
  <p><i>Multitasking: Allows more than one program to run concurrently.</i></p>
  <p><em>Multithreading: Allows different parts of a single program to run concurrently.</em></p>
  <p><mark>Real time: Responds to input instantly.<br> General-purpose operating systems, suchas DOS and UNIX, are not real-time.</mark></p>
  <br>
  <h2><b>MOST POPULAR DESKTOP OPERATING SYSTEMS</b></h2>
  <h3><b>WINDOWS</b></h3>
  <p><small>Microsoft Windows is a family of operating systems for personal and business computers. Windows dominates the personal computer world, providing graphical user interfaces (GUI), virtual memory management, multitasking, and support for many peripheral devices.</small></p>
  
  <h3><b>MAC</b></h3>
  <p><del>Mac OS is the official name of the Apple Macintosh operating system. Mac OS features a graphical user interface (GUI) that utilizes windows, icons, and allapplications running on a Macintosh computer have a similar user interface.</del></p>
  
  <h3><b>LINUX</b></h3>
  <p><ins>According to Netmarketshare.com, the most used desktop operating system and versions used on PCs (desktops and laptops) from January to November, 2019 are:</ins></p>
  <p><sub>Windows 87.40%<br> Mac OS 10.06%<br> Linux 1.95%<br> Chrome OS 0.39%<br> Unknown 0.20%<br> BSD 0.01%</sub></p>
  <br>
  <h2><b>MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEMS</b></h2>
  <p><sup>In the same way that a desktop operating system controls your desktop or laptop computer, mobile operating systems are designed specifically to run on mobile devices such as mobile phones, smartphones, PDAs, tablet computers andother handhelds.</sup></p>
